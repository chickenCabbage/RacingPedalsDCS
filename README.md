# RacingPedalsDCS
Translates Saitek R220 racing pedals into a virtual Xbox-360 game controller, for flying in DCS.

Since the Saitek R220 pedals (and likely others) are incompatible with flying in DCS, in their original (virtual) axis layout, I adapted them to something that *is* compatible with flying.
